# Gen Menu: AI-Powered Menu Data Extractor

An interactive web application that automates the tedious process of digitizing restaurant menus. This tool allows a user to upload a menu as a multi-page PDF or an image, and leverages the power of **Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet** to intelligently extract all items, categories, descriptions, and prices into a structured format.

The final output is a ready-to-use Excel file, perfectly formatted for bulk upload into e-commerce systems like Hyperzod, transforming hours of manual data entry into a task of minutes.
